## To clone dev environment follow these instructions:

### `git clone https://github.com/siman4457/project-planner`

Once in the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
